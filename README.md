# Early-Australian-Forest-Fire-Detection-Project
This project  is inspired by 'Fire surrounding, not a tree or there friend(animal) alive!'. This line perfectly fits the Australia forest fires, which became a global concern . It is crucial to prevent such forest fires if we wish to fight against climate change. And a solution for this can be provided by deep learning algorithms.
